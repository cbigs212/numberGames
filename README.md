This repository holds two pieces of code that takes in user input and returns info regarding numbers

Guess the number:
* The program has the user guess a secret number between 20-700, 
 * inclusive. The computer randomly generates the secret number and 
 * allows the user to continually input numbers until they correctly guess 
 * the secret number

Number Data:
 * Writes a program that prompts the user to enter a series of numbers between 
 * 1-500 (inclusive). The program keeps accepting numbers until the user enters 
 * a value outside of the specified range. Once the user enters a value outside 
 * of 1-500, the program displays how many terms were entered, 
 * their minimum value, their average value, as well as a count for how 
 * many of the numbers are even numbers.
