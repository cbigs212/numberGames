 * Writes a program that prompts the user to enter a series of numbers between

 * a value outside of the specified range. Once the user enters a value outside 
 * of 1-500, the program displays how many terms were entered, 
 * their minimum value, their average value, as well as a count for how 
 * many of the numbers are even numbers.
